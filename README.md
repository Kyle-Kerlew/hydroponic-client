# Hydroponic Monitoring Dashboard

This is a cyberpunk themed frontend dashboard for monitoring my personal hydroponic system at my home. The data shown is fetched from an ESP8266 microcontroller that is connected to a  temperature sensor, a PH sensor, and a TDS sensor. The frontend polls the ESP8266 every 10 seconds for new data and updates the dashboard accordingly.
